# Workshop Activity

### **Introduction:**

In this workshop, you will gain hands-on experience integrating Static Application Security Testing (SAST) with SonarCloud and Software Composition Analysis (SCA) with Snyk into a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline. This activity is designed to solidify your practical understanding of these essential security practices, equipping you with the skills necessary to improve the security and quality of your codebase.

### **Workshop Steps:**

Follow the same steps outlined in the [**Live Demo - Implementing SAST and SCA**](live-demo-implementing-sast-and-sca.md) section. However, ensure that you update the names used in the instructions to match the specific names and configurations of your project. This will help you apply the learned concepts to your own environment and reinforce the skills necessary for real-world application.

### **Conclusion:**

By completing this workshop, you have deepened your understanding of integrating SAST and SCA into CI pipelines. These practices are vital for maintaining the security and quality of software in a professional development environment. As you continue to apply these techniques, youâ€™ll be better prepared to identify and address potential vulnerabilities and quality issues, ensuring that your projects remain secure and robust throughout the development lifecycle.
