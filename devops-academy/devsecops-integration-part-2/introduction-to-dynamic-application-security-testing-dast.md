# Introduction to Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)

### **Introduction**

Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) is a key component in the DevSecOps pipeline. Unlike Static Application Security Testing (SAST), which inspects an application's source code, DAST evaluates a running application to identify vulnerabilities. By simulating real-world attacks, DAST allows you to detect security flaws that might only become apparent when the application is running, making it an indispensable tool for ensuring application security.

### **What is DAST?**

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/dast.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>DAST</p></figcaption></figure>

Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) is a security testing methodology that focuses on identifying vulnerabilities in a running application. Here's how DAST operates:

1. **Simulates External Attacks:** DAST tools operate like external attackers, probing the application without access to the source code. This "black-box" approach allows DAST to uncover vulnerabilities that only manifest during runtime.
2. **Scans for Vulnerabilities:** DAST scans the application from the outside to identify vulnerabilities such as:
   * **SQL Injection**
   * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
   * **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**
   * **Insecure Server Configurations**
3. **Interacts with the Application:** DAST tools interact with the application in real-time, sending various inputs and monitoring responses to detect security flaws.

{% hint style="info" %}
DAST is often referred to as "black-box" testing because it evaluates the application from the outside, mimicking the perspective of an attacker without requiring access to the source code.
{% endhint %}

**Example:**\
Consider an e-commerce application that processes user payments. A DAST tool could simulate a series of malicious transactions to identify weaknesses in payment processing, such as a vulnerability that allows unauthorized discounts through input manipulation.

### **How Does DAST Work?**

DAST operates through a structured process designed to mimic the behavior of potential attackers. Here's how it typically works:

1. **Crawling the Application:**
   * The DAST tool begins by crawling the application to discover all accessible endpoints, such as:
     * Web pages
     * Forms
     * APIs
   * This crawling phase maps out the attack surface of the application, identifying all potential entry points for an attacker.
2. **Sending Test Requests:**
   * The DAST tool then sends a series of crafted requests designed to test for vulnerabilities, including:
     * **SQL Injection:** Sending malicious SQL queries to identify if the application improperly handles database queries.
     * **XSS:** Injecting scripts into input fields to see if they are executed in the user's browser.
     * **CSRF:** Testing if unauthorized actions can be performed on behalf of a user.
3. **Analyzing Responses:**
   * The responses from the application are analyzed to identify potential vulnerabilities. For example:
     * An unexpected SQL error message may indicate a SQL injection vulnerability.
     * Redirects or unexpected responses may reveal security flaws.
4. **Reporting Findings:**
   * Finally, the DAST tool generates a detailed report, highlighting the vulnerabilities discovered, their severity, and recommended remediation steps.

**Example:**\
A DAST tool might inject a SQL command into a search bar to see if the application is vulnerable to SQL injection. If the application responds with an error revealing the database structure, the tool will flag this as a critical vulnerability.

### **OWASP ZAP**

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/owasp-zap.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>OWASP ZAP</p></figcaption></figure>

OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy) is one of the most popular and widely used DAST tools. Developed by the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP), ZAP is an open-source tool that helps find security vulnerabilities in web applications during development and testing.

**Key Features of OWASP ZAP:**

1. **Automated Scanning:**
   * ZAP includes automated scanners that can quickly identify common vulnerabilities.
2. **Manual Testing Tools:**
   * In addition to automated scanning, ZAP offers a range of manual tools for in-depth security analysis, including:
     * **Fuzzer:** A tool to test how applications handle unexpected inputs.
     * **Intercepting Proxy:** Allows testers to intercept and modify requests between the browser and the web application.
3. **Active Community Support:**
   * OWASP ZAP has a large community of users and contributors, ensuring continuous updates and improvements.
4. **Integration with CI/CD Pipelines:**
   * ZAP can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines, enabling automated security testing as part of the build process.

{% hint style="info" %}
OWASP ZAP is often chosen for DAST due to its ability to integrate seamlessly into CI/CD pipelines, supporting both automated and manual testing.
{% endhint %}

**Example:**\
A development team might integrate OWASP ZAP into their CI/CD pipeline to automatically scan their web application for vulnerabilities every time new code is deployed to a staging environment.

### **Types of Vulnerabilities Detected by DAST**

DAST is particularly effective at detecting a variety of vulnerabilities, many of which are critical to securing a web application:

1. **Injection Attacks:**
   * **SQL Injection:** Occurs when an attacker can insert or manipulate SQL queries within the application’s input fields, potentially allowing them to access or modify database content.
   * **Example:** A poorly validated login form that accepts SQL commands like `1' OR '1'='1` might allow attackers to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access.
2. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
   * **XSS Vulnerabilities:** Allow attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages, which can be executed in the context of another user’s browser.
   * **Example:** A comment field that doesn't sanitize input could allow an attacker to inject JavaScript that steals session cookies from other users who view the page.
3. **Authentication and Session Management Issues:**
   * **Weak Authentication:** Occurs when authentication mechanisms are insecure, such as allowing weak passwords or not properly securing session tokens.
   * **Example:** An application that stores session tokens in cookies without proper encryption could allow attackers to hijack user sessions by intercepting these tokens.
4. **Insecure Configurations:**
   * **Misconfigurations:** Involve improper settings in servers or applications that expose them to attacks, such as enabling directory listings or leaving default credentials in place.
   * **Example:** A web server with directory listing enabled might inadvertently expose sensitive files to attackers.

### **Pros and Cons of DAST**

Like any security testing method, DAST has its strengths and limitations. Understanding these can help in effectively implementing DAST in your security strategy.

#### **Pros:**

1. **Broad Coverage:**
   * DAST can test the entire application, including components and services that might be missed by SAST or other security tests.
2. **Realistic Testing:**
   * Since DAST interacts with the running application, it can uncover vulnerabilities that only manifest in a live environment.
3. **Ease of Use:**
   * DAST tools are generally easy to integrate into existing CI/CD pipelines and do not require access to the source code.

**Example:**\
DAST can identify a misconfigured server in production that static analysis might miss, providing a more comprehensive security assessment.

#### **Cons:**

1. **Limited Code Insight:**
   * DAST cannot see the underlying code, which may limit its ability to detect certain types of vulnerabilities.
2. **Performance Impact:**
   * Running DAST in production or production-like environments can impact application performance if not managed carefully.
3. **False Positives:**
   * Like many security tools, DAST can sometimes generate false positives, requiring manual review and validation.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Always review DAST findings carefully to differentiate between genuine vulnerabilities and false positives.

### **Importance of DAST in DevSecOps**

DAST plays a crucial role in the DevSecOps pipeline, where the integration of security practices into the development and operations processes is essential. The benefits of DAST in this context include:

* **Continuous Security Testing:** DAST ensures that security testing is not just a one-time activity but a continuous process that occurs throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC).
* **Early Detection of Vulnerabilities:** By integrating DAST into CI/CD pipelines, security issues can be detected and addressed early, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities being deployed to production.
* **Enhanced Collaboration:** DAST fosters collaboration between development, security, and operations teams, ensuring that security is a shared responsibility.

**Example:**\
In a DevSecOps pipeline, DAST can be scheduled to run automatically on staging environments, identifying vulnerabilities before the application is deployed to production, thereby reducing the attack surface.

***

### **DAST in Production-like Environments**

For DAST to be most effective, it should be run in environments that closely resemble production. This ensures that:

* **Test Results Are Accurate:** Running DAST in a staging environment that mirrors production allows for the identification of vulnerabilities that are likely to exist in the live environment.
* **Risks Are Mitigated:** By testing in a controlled environment, vulnerabilities can be identified and fixed before they impact real users.

**Best Practices:**

1. **Use Staging Environments:**
   * Test in an environment that replicates the production setup, including all services, configurations, and data flows.
2. **Implement Safeguards:**
   * Ensure that DAST tests do not disrupt normal operations by running them during off-peak hours and monitoring the application's performance.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Never run DAST directly against a live production environment without proper safeguards, as it could disrupt normal operations.
{% endhint %}
