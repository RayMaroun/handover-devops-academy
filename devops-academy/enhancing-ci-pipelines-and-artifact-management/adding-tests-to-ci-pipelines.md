# Adding Tests to CI Pipelines

### **Introduction**

Integrating tests into your Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline is a critical step in ensuring the reliability and quality of your software. By automating unit and functional tests within the CI pipeline, you can catch issues early in the development process, provide immediate feedback to developers, and maintain a high standard of code quality. In this lesson, we will explore how to integrate various types of tests into your CI pipeline, how to manage test execution through tags, and best practices for ensuring comprehensive test automation.

### **Integrating Unit Tests into CI Pipelines**

Unit tests are the foundation of automated testing. They focus on individual components or functions of your code, ensuring that each one performs as expected in isolation. Integrating unit tests into your CI pipeline is crucial for catching bugs early in the development process.

#### **Steps to Integrate Unit Tests:**

1.  **Add Unit Test Execution to Your Pipeline:**

    You can integrate unit tests by adding a step in your CI pipeline configuration that runs the test suite.

    **Example in YAML:**

    ```yaml
    jobs:
    - job: Build  # Job for building the application
      steps:
      - script: mvn clean compile  # Command to clean and compile the Maven project
        displayName: 'Compile the project'  # Display name for the compile step
      
      - script: mvn test  # Command to run unit tests using Maven
        displayName: 'Run Unit Tests'  # Display name for the unit test step
    ```

    **Explanation:**

    In this example, after compiling the project, the `mvn test` command runs all the unit tests. This step ensures that any failures are detected immediately, stopping the pipeline if necessary.
2.  **Configure the Testing Framework:**

    Ensure that your testing framework (JUnit, NUnit, etc.) is properly configured in your project. This configuration should include the location of test files and any necessary environment settings.
3.  **Automated Reporting:**

    Integrate automated reporting tools to generate and visualize test results. This can be done by configuring your CI tool to parse the test results and display them in a dashboard or send notifications.

    **Example in YAML:**

    {% code overflow="wrap" %}
    ```yaml
    - task: PublishTestResults@2  # Task to publish test results
      inputs:
        testResultsFiles: '**/TEST-*.xml'  # Pattern to match the test results files (in this case, XML files)
        testRunTitle: 'Unit Test Results'  # Title for the test run in the results
    ```
    {% endcode %}

    **Explanation:**

    This task publishes the test results, making them available in the CI system's interface for easy review.

<summary>Best Practices for Unit Testing in CI Pipelines</summary>

* **Keep Tests Fast:** Ensure unit tests run quickly to prevent bottlenecks in your CI pipeline.
* **Isolate Tests:** Avoid dependencies between unit tests to reduce flakiness.
* **Automate Everything:** Automate not just the test execution, but also the setup, teardown, and reporting of tests.

</details>

### **Integrating Functional Tests into CI Pipelines**

Functional tests validate that your application behaves as expected from an end-user perspective. These tests are crucial for ensuring that the application's features work correctly.

#### **Steps to Integrate Functional Tests:**

1.  **Add Functional Test Execution to Your Pipeline:**

    Like unit tests, functional tests can be integrated into the CI pipeline by adding a step to execute them.

    **Example in YAML:**

    {% code overflow="wrap" %}
    ```yaml
    jobs:
    - job: FunctionalTests  # Job for running functional tests
      dependsOn: Build  # This job depends on the successful completion of the Build job
      steps:
      - script: mvn verify  # Command to run functional tests and other checks using Maven
        displayName: 'Run Functional Tests'  # Display name for the functional test step
    ```
    {% endcode %}

    **Explanation:**

    This job runs functional tests after the build job completes successfully. The `mvn verify` command typically runs integration and functional tests.
2.  **Environment Setup:**

    Ensure that the necessary environment (e.g., database, APIs, services) is available for running functional tests. You can use Docker containers or cloud services to create isolated test environments.
3.  **Parallel Test Execution:**

    To reduce the time it takes to run functional tests, consider running them in parallel. This is especially important for large test suites.

    **Example in YAML:**

    ```yaml
    jobs:
    - job: FunctionalTests  # Job for running functional tests
      pool:
        vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'  # Use the latest Ubuntu VM image for the job
      strategy:
        parallel: 4  # Run the job in parallel using 4 agents
      steps:
      - script: mvn verify  # Command to run functional tests and other checks using Maven
        displayName: 'Run Functional Tests'  # Display name for the functional test step
    ```

    **Explanation:**

    In this example, the `strategy` block configures the job to run in parallel across four virtual machines, significantly speeding up the test process.

### **`mvn test` vs `mvn verify`**

#### **`mvn test`**

* **Purpose:** Runs unit tests only.
* **Usage:** Used during development to quickly verify that the code works as expected.
* **Execution:** Compiles code and runs tests found in `src/test/java`.
* **Example:** `mvn test` compiles the code and executes unit tests, but doesn't package the application or run integration tests.

#### **`mvn verify`**

* **Purpose:** Runs unit tests, integration tests, and performs additional checks.
* **Usage:** Used in CI/CD pipelines to ensure the project is fully validated.
* **Execution:** Includes everything in `mvn test`, plus additional phases like integration testing and artifact validation.
* **Example:** `mvn verify` ensures the project meets all criteria for deployment, making it a more comprehensive check than `mvn test`.

In short, `mvn test` is for quick checks during development, while `mvn verify` is for full project validation before deployment.

### **Managing Test Execution with Tags**

Tags are a powerful tool for managing which tests are executed in different scenarios. For example, you may want to run a smaller set of critical tests on every commit and a more comprehensive set of tests nightly.

#### **Using Tags to Control Test Execution:**

1.  **Tagging Tests in Your Code:**

    In many testing frameworks, you can add tags to your tests to categorize them. These tags can then be used in your CI pipeline to control which tests are run.

    **Example in JUnit:**

    {% code overflow="wrap" %}
    ```java
    @Tag("smoke")  // Tag this test as a "smoke" test
    @Test
    void criticalTest() {
        // Critical test code here
        // This test is likely focused on verifying that the most essential and basic functionalities of the application are working correctly.
    }

    @Tag("regression")  // Tag this test as a "regression" test
    @Test
    void comprehensiveTest() {
        // Comprehensive test code here
        // This test is likely more detailed, aimed at ensuring that new changes haven't broken existing functionality.
    }
    ```
    {% endcode %}

    **Explanation:**

    In this example, one test is tagged as a `smoke` test (critical and fast), while another is tagged as a `regression` test (more comprehensive).
2.  **Configuring the CI Pipeline to Run Tagged Tests:**

    You can configure your CI pipeline to run different sets of tests based on tags. This allows you to optimize the testing process by running only the necessary tests at each stage.

    **Example in YAML:**

    {% code overflow="wrap" %}
    ```yaml
    jobs:
    - job: RunSmokeTests  # Job for running smoke tests
      steps:
      - script: mvn test -Dgroups=smoke  # Command to run Maven tests, specifically targeting the "smoke" test group
        displayName: 'Run Smoke Tests'  # Display name for the smoke test step

    - job: RunRegressionTests  # Job for running regression tests
      steps:
      - script: mvn test -Dgroups=regression  # Command to run Maven tests, specifically targeting the "regression" test group
        displayName: 'Run Regression Tests'  # Display name for the regression test step
    ```
    {% endcode %}

    **Explanation:**

    The `mvn test -Dgroups=smoke` command runs only the tests tagged as `smoke`, ensuring that only critical tests are run, saving time and resources.

<details>

<summary>Best Practices for Using Tags in Test Management</summary>

* **Tag Strategically:** Use tags to categorize tests by priority, type, or environment to streamline test execution.
* **Combine Tags:** Combine multiple tags to run different subsets of tests depending on the scenario (e.g., `smoke` and `regression`).
* **Review and Update Tags:** Regularly review and update tags to ensure they reflect the current testing needs and strategies.

</details>

#### **Combining Multiple Groups:**

You can also combine multiple groups when running tests:

*   **Include Multiple Groups:**

    ```bash
    mvn test -Dgroups="group1,group2"
    ```

    This command will run all tests tagged with either `group1` or `group2`.
*   **Logical Operations (AND):**

    ```bash
    mvn test -Dgroups="group1 & group2"
    ```

    This command runs only the tests that are tagged with both `group1` and `group2`.
*   **Exclude Groups:**

    ```bash
    mvn test -Dgroups="group1" -DexcludedGroups="group2"
    ```

    This command includes tests with `group1` but excludes those tagged with `group2`.

By using tags effectively, you can manage and optimize your test execution strategy, running only what is necessary at each stage of your CI/CD pipeline.

### **Ensuring Comprehensive Test Automation**

To maximize the benefits of continuous testing, it's essential to ensure that your tests are comprehensive, covering all critical aspects of your application.

#### **Key Strategies for Comprehensive Test Automation:**

1.  **Test Coverage:**

    Ensure that your automated tests cover all critical paths, edge cases, and scenarios. Use code coverage tools to measure how much of your code is being tested.

    **Example Tool:**

    * **JaCoCo:** A popular code coverage tool for Java that integrates with Maven and Gradle.
2.  **Automate Everything:**

    Aim to automate as much of the testing process as possible, from unit tests to deployment verification tests. The less manual intervention required, the faster and more reliable your CI pipeline will be.
3.  **Continuous Monitoring and Improvement:**

    Regularly review your test automation setup to identify gaps, remove obsolete tests, and add new ones as your codebase evolves.

    **Example Tool:**

    * **SonarQube:** A tool that provides continuous inspection of code quality and can be integrated into CI pipelines to enforce code quality standards.

<details>

<summary>Additional Considerations for Test Automation</summary>

* **Focus on Stability:** Ensure that your tests are stable and reliable to avoid false positives and negatives.
* **Optimize Test Execution:** Use techniques like parallel testing and selective test execution to keep the CI pipeline fast and efficient.
* **Integrate with Deployment:** Automate deployment tests to ensure that every release is thoroughly tested before it goes live.

</details>
