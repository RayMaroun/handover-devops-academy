# Unit Testing

Unit testing is a fundamental practice in software development that involves testing individual components or units of code in isolation to ensure they work correctly. It is a crucial part of the testing pyramid, providing the foundation for more complex tests like integration and end-to-end tests. This page provides a detailed explanation of unit testing, its significance, best practices, and concepts relevant to the course.

Unit testing involves testing the smallest parts of an application, such as functions, methods, or classes, independently from the rest of the system. The primary goal is to validate that each unit of the software performs as expected.

* **Isolation:** Each unit test should focus on a single piece of functionality in isolation, without depending on external systems like databases or APIs.
* **Automation:** Unit tests are usually automated and run as part of the continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline.

***

### **Significance of Unit Testing**

1. **Early Detection of Bugs:** Unit tests catch bugs early in the development cycle, making them easier and cheaper to fix.
2. **Documentation:** Unit tests serve as documentation for the code, illustrating how different parts of the application are expected to function.
3. **Refactoring Confidence:** With a comprehensive suite of unit tests, developers can refactor code with confidence, knowing that any unintended changes will be caught.
4. **Cost-Effective:** Fixing bugs during the unit testing phase is more cost-effective than addressing issues later in the development cycle or after deployment.

### **Best Practices for Unit Testing**

1. **Write Independent Tests:** Ensure that each test can run independently and does not depend on the state or output of other tests.
2. **Use Mocks:** Use mock objects to simulate dependencies and isolate the unit under test. This helps in testing the unit's behavior in controlled scenarios.
3. **Test One Thing at a Time:** Focus on testing a single aspect of the unit's functionality in each test case. This helps in identifying the exact cause of failure when a test breaks.
4. **Keep Tests Small and Focused:** Write small, focused tests that are easy to understand and maintain. Avoid writing complex tests that cover multiple functionalities.
5. **Name Tests Clearly:** Use descriptive names for test methods to indicate what functionality they are testing. This makes it easier to understand the purpose of each test.

### What is Mockito?

Mockito is a popular mocking framework for unit tests in Java. It allows developers to create mock objects and define their behavior for testing purposes. By using Mockito, you can simulate the behavior of complex dependencies and isolate the unit of code you are testing. This helps ensure that your unit tests are focused and reliable.

**Key Features of Mockito:**

1. **Mock Creation:** Easily create mock objects for any class or interface.
2. **Behavior Stubbing:** Define the behavior of mock methods and specify return values.
3. **Verification:** Verify that specific methods on mock objects were called with the expected parameters.
4. **Annotations:** Use annotations like `@Mock` and `@InjectMocks` to simplify the setup of mock objects.
5. **Flexible Verification:** Verify the number of times a method was called, or even verify that no interactions occurred.

### **Key Concepts Relevant to Unit Testing**

#### **Key Concepts Relevant to Unit Testing**

1.  **Mocking Dependencies:** In unit testing, itâ€™s crucial to isolate the unit under test from its dependencies. This is where mocking comes in. For example, if you're testing a service that interacts with a database, you would mock the database interactions to focus solely on the service's logic. This approach prevents tests from failing due to issues in the dependencies.

    ```java
    // Example using Mockito in a Java application

    import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;
    import static org.mockito.Mockito.verify;
    import static org.mockito.Mockito.when;

    import java.util.Optional;

    import org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach;
    import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
    import org.mockito.InjectMocks;
    import org.mockito.Mock;
    import org.mockito.MockitoAnnotations;

    /**
     * Test class for UserService using Mockito for mocking dependencies.
     */
    public class UserServiceTest {

        @Mock
        private UserRepository userRepository; // Mocking the UserRepository

        @InjectMocks
        private UserService userService; // Injecting the mocks into UserService

        /**
         * Sets up the test environment before each test.
         * Initializes the mocks.
         */
        @BeforeEach
        void setUp() {
            MockitoAnnotations.openMocks(this);
        }

        /**
         * Test case for the getUserById method in UserService.
         * It verifies that the method returns the correct user details.
         */
        @Test
        void testGetUserById() {
            // Creating a mock user
            User mockUser = new User(1, "John Doe");
            // Defining the behavior of the userRepository mock
            when(userRepository.findById(1)).thenReturn(Optional.of(mockUser));

            // Calling the getUserById method
            User user = userService.getUserById(1);

            // Asserting that the returned user's name is "John Doe"
            assertEquals("John Doe", user.getName());
            // Verifying that the findById method of userRepository was called with the correct ID
            verify(userRepository).findById(1);
        }
    }
    ```
2.  **Assertions:** Assertions are used to check whether the actual output of the code matches the expected result. Common assertions include checking for equality, non-null values, or whether a specific condition is true.

    ```java
    // Example using JUnit assertions in a Java application

    import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;
    import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

    /**
     * Test class for verifying the calculateTotalPrice method of ShoppingCart.
     */
    public class ShoppingCartTest {

        /**
         * Test case for the calculateTotalPrice method in ShoppingCart.
         * It verifies that the total price is calculated correctly.
         */
        @Test
        void testCalculateTotalPrice() {
            // Create a new instance of ShoppingCart
            ShoppingCart cart = new ShoppingCart();
            
            // Add a book item to the cart with a price of 12.99
            cart.addItem(new Item("Book", 12.99));
            // Add a pen item to the cart with a price of 1.49
            cart.addItem(new Item("Pen", 1.49));

            // Calculate the total price of items in the cart
            double totalPrice = cart.calculateTotalPrice();

            // Assert that the total price is 14.48 with a tolerance of 0.001
            assertEquals(14.48, totalPrice, 0.001);
        }
    }
    ```
3.  **Setup and Teardown:** In unit testing frameworks, methods annotated with `@BeforeEach` (JUnit) or equivalent are used to set up the test environment before each test case. Similarly, `@AfterEach` can be used to clean up resources after each test.

    ```java
    // Example using JUnit setup and teardown methods

    import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;
    import org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach;
    import org.junit.jupiter.api.AfterEach;
    import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

    /**
     * Test class for the Calculator.
     * Demonstrates the use of JUnit setup and teardown methods.
     */
    public class CalculatorTest {
        private Calculator calculator;

        /**
         * Sets up the test environment before each test.
         * Initializes the Calculator instance.
         */
        @BeforeEach
        void setUp() {
            calculator = new Calculator();
        }

        /**
         * Cleans up the test environment after each test.
         * Sets the Calculator instance to null.
         */
        @AfterEach
        void tearDown() {
            calculator = null; // Clean up resources
        }

        /**
         * Test case for the add method in Calculator.
         * It verifies that the add method returns the correct sum of two numbers.
         */
        @Test
        void testAdd() {
            // Assert that the sum of 2 and 3 is 5
            assertEquals(5, calculator.add(2, 3));
        }
    }
    ```
4.  **Tagging Tests:** Tests can be categorized using tags (e.g., `@Tag("unit")` in JUnit). This helps in organizing and selectively running tests based on their purpose, such as running only unit tests or integration tests.

    ```java
    // Example using JUnit tags

    import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;
    import org.junit.jupiter.api.Tag;
    import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

    /**
     * Test class for the Calculator.
     * Demonstrates the use of JUnit tags to categorize tests.
     */
    public class CalculatorTest {

        /**
         * Test case for the multiply method in Calculator.
         * This test is tagged as a "unit" test.
         * It verifies that the multiply method returns the correct product of two numbers.
         */
        @Tag("unit")
        @Test
        void testMultiply() {
            // Create a new instance of Calculator
            Calculator calculator = new Calculator();
            
            // Assert that the product of 2 and 3 is 6
            assertEquals(6, calculator.multiply(2, 3));
        }
    }
    ```
5.  **Testing for Exceptions:** Unit tests should also verify that methods handle exceptional situations correctly. This includes testing for expected exceptions or error messages when invalid inputs are provided.

    ```java
    // Example using JUnit to test for exceptions

    import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertThrows;
    import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

    /**
     * Test class for the Calculator.
     * Demonstrates the use of JUnit to test for exceptions.
     */
    public class CalculatorTest {

        /**
         * Test case for the divide method in Calculator.
         * It verifies that the divide method throws an ArithmeticException when dividing by zero.
         */
        @Test
        void testDivideByZero() {
            // Create a new instance of Calculator
            Calculator calculator = new Calculator();

            // Assert that an ArithmeticException is thrown when dividing by zero
            assertThrows(ArithmeticException.class, () -> {
                calculator.divide(10, 0);
            });
        }
    }
    ```
